1. Print in console all the classes and their parent class. If there is no
   parent, print null.
2. Print all class variables along with their type and class name.
3. Print all function variables along with their type and function name.
4. Print all functions along with their argument numbers, argument types  and

5. Create a hash table to store all class related informations
    + Class name
    + Parent name
    + function names with all function related details as in 4 above
    + var names with type
6. You might have learnt the rules for type checking a program. Create a program
   with that violates one such rule. Input that program to your type checker.
   See whether, your program captures the type error. If it captures, then print
   in console "Type error".
