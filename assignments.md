## Academic Integrity

You’re in college; you’re expected and encouraged to discuss your work with
others. That said, **everything you write for this course (code, written
assignments, quizzes, exams and everything else) must be your own original
work.**

**Properly attribute any work that you use**. It is part of your job as a
scholar to understand what counts as plagiarism, and make sure you avoid it.
